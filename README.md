#Omnifood

The emphasis of this project was to improve my web-designing skills, as my
ultimate goal is to become a front-end developer.  I undertook a course on
web-design and as a final project in this course i had to create a website for
superfulous client Omnifood.  The focus of this web-site was to attract users
to subscribe to a monthly food delivery contract.

#APPROACH

The course had fairly detailed instructions on the code behind the design.
However instead of merely copying the instructions, I attempted to work out for
myself how to Before starting coding I started planning, sketching and thinking
about the content.  After having all the content ready I started coding and
with every line of code I understood how important is to keep the code
organized and clean, because as the project grows the possibility to have a
mess in code is really high so the best way to avoid it is to keep it clean
from the beginning.

#CONCLUSIONS

During this project I understood how JQuery plugins works and how to arrange
CSS code and also how the box model in HTML works with all the properties.  I
also gained a deeper understanding of design principles as colors, fonts,
images, arrangement of the content and also how to optimize the website before
launching it online.
